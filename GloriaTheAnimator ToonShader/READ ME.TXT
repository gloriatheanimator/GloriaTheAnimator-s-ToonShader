This toon shader was made by GloriaTheAnimator

for free and open source usage

you can modify it as you wish

all i ask in return is that when you use it to credit me (GloriaTheAnimator) for the free shader

you can preview how the shader works under difrent lighing conditions by

checking/unchecking the premade light collections, or by moving the lights

thank you for using this little toon shader <3

if you have any questions or suggestions contact me on twitter (@GloriaAnimator) or

on discord (GloriaTheAnimator#0165)

ill add them to a future Q&A for this shader here

(why does my shader look so colorless?)

make sure you use the blender standard instead of filmic

filmic is good for realism and low contrast, but this shader requires bright colors and lots of contrast



please send me your wonderful things that you make with this shader id love to show them off here and on my twitter and discord <3
