This toon shader was made by GloriaTheAnimator
for free and open source usage 
you can modify it as you wish
all i ask in return is that when you use it to credit me (GloriaTheAnimator) for the free shader

you can preview how the shader works under difrent lighing conditions by
checking/unchecking the premade light collections, or by moving the lights

thank you for using this little toon shader <3
